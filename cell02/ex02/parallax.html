        <h2>BTS</h2>
        <p>BTS stands for the Korean phrase Bangtan Sonyeondan (Korean: 방탄소년단; Hanja: 防彈少年團), which translates literally to 'Bulletproof Boy Scouts'. According to J-Hope, the name signifies the group's desire "to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets".In Japan, they are known as Bōdan Shōnendan (防弾少年団).In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for "Beyond the Scene" as part of their new brand identity.This extended the meaning of their name to encompass the idea of growth "from a boy to an adult who opens the doors that are facing forward".</p>
